# Slingshot

This is a game developed in a team of four during the 3rd semester of a BA Game Design course.  

## The concept  

We wanted to create a lightweight, fun, action game that focuses on speed and destruction as satisfying core mechanics.  
It is originally developed for controller but might be ported to mobile in the future.

## Have a look!  

This repository contains the entire Unity project, NOT the build.  
To play, run the Unity Editor and play inside it.
